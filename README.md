# Awesome-LLM-for-Chart [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of papers and resources on using **Large Language Models (LLMs) for Chart Understanding**, including chart data extraction, visual reasoning, chart-based QA, and chart-to-knowledge generation.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing, vision, and multimodal tasks. Among these, understanding and reasoning over **Data Visualizations**—such as charts, plots, and graphs—is emerging as a critical research direction.  
This repository aims to bridge the gap between **Chart Understanding** and **Large Language Models** by collecting high-quality research papers and resources that explore how LLMs can be applied to **extract**, **interpret**, and **reason** about visual data representations in charts.
